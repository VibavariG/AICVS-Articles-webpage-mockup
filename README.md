# AICVS-Articles-webpage-mockup
This site is live at: https://vibavarig.github.io/AICVS-Articles-webpage-mockup/
This entire site was created by me for the AICVS (Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision Society), and was just the mockup before they got their content. 
So all the content in it is just Lorem Ipsum. Go to the Articles tab on the top right corner.
