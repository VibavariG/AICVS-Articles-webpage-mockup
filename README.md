# AICVS-Articles-webpage-mockup
This site is live at: https://vibavarig.github.io/AICVS-Articles-webpage-mockup/articles

This entire page was created by me for the AICVS (Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision Society), and was just the mockup before they got their content. 

So all the content in it is just Lorem Ipsum. I've created separate cards for each article they would publish, and embedded an image, title and a preview of the article in one card. Clicking on the title of each article takes you to that article page. Clicking on the Articles tab on the top right corner or the browser back button would again take to to the articles page. 

This page is responsive and uses the screensize as a parameter to adjust itself.
